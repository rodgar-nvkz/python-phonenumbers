Please do not report issues that can be reproduced with the [upstream Java project](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber): if your issue can be reproduced with the [online Java demo](http://libphonenumber.appspot.com/), report your [problem upstream](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#checklist-before-filing-an-issue) instead.

In particular, any changes to the phonenumber metadata or to the API should be reported upstream rather than here.  Only issues or contributions that are **specific to the Python version** are relevant here.
