Contributing to python-phonenumbers
===================================

Contributions are welcome, but please be aware that the project is directly
derived from the
[upstream Java project](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber).

As a result, any changes to the phonenumber metadata or to the API should be
[submitted there](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/pulls)
rather than here; only issues or contributions that are specific to the Python
version are likely to be relevant here.
